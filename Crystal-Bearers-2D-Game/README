-- IMPORTANT NOTE -- 
  o. Most of the art assets used in this project were paid for. However, the license agreement was lost. Due to this, none of the paid for assets were loaded into this Repo.
  o. This means that the game cannot be compiled and played by other users. This repository serves as proof of work only and not as a functional game. 
  o. Gameplay footage of the functionality will be added later

-- Instructions & Manuals --

The game can be started up in two ways. Either a) run the executable included in this
submission from a Windows 10 operating system (running it from in the folder it is, as it needs
some of those surrounding files to run), or b) the files submitted can be loaded into Unity and
the game run from there (as well as allowing the project as a whole to be viewed). If method b is
used be sure to start from the “Start Menu” scene.

Once started, you will see the Title Screen. From here, either choose (click on) New Game,
which will take you to the Rose City (named BasicTown in files) or you can choose
Load/Continue and select a previously saved game.
